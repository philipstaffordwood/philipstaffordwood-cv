      details: |
        Principal DevOps Engineer for BVNK serving mostly on the Grindrod Bank Bigbaobab team.

        Bigbaobab was a Grindrod Bank initiative to rebuild their Core Banking system using a modern microservice architecture.

        My main role was to build out the DevOps environment and toolchain and to advise on application and platform design and architecture. 

        This included scripting their Kubernetes platform builds using Terraform and Ansible on AWS, Digital Ocean and on on-prem hardware.

        It also included the scripting of the provisioning of their CI/CD infrastructure: Jenkins, SonarQube and Artifactory, as well as developing CI/CD pipelines to build, test, statically analise, package, publish and deploy their microservice artifacts.
        
        For BVNK in-house needs I helped automate and build our demo instance Kubernetes infrastructure on a low cost Hetzner box.

      company: BCX
      details: |
        As member of a velocity team (our brief was: concept to POC, then handover to
        implementation team to do POC to MVP) I worked on analyzing a legacy codebase of more than
        15,000,000 lines of Java code to advise on for refactoring approaches. This was done using a collection
        of open source tools with custom needs met with [JavaParser](http://javaparser.org/) with visualizations
        done with [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)

        I also implemented a POC point-solution to implement product activation functionality by reusing base
        Java Elliptic Curve Cryptography primitives for digital signatures to produce human-readable activation
        codes.

        This role then transitioned into being the lead analyst for the integration part of a large integration project using [WSO2 Enterprise Integrator](https://wso2.com/integration/)

        I helped to establish an Enterprise Integration Centre of Excellence while contracted out to the South
        African Reserve Bank.

        Initialy I led a small four person team to develop all the models and processes and templates to establish the
        Centre of Excellence: including the _Vision, Mission & Mandate_, the _Target Operating Model_, various
        _Business Processes_, etc..

        I subsequently served as the demand coordinator, the support lead and finally the ops manager for three
        integration ops teams administering the key SARB Integration platforms for the CoE.
        
        As Ops Manager I led:

        * a two-person Oracle SOA Suite team maintaining the integration infrastructure connecting their core banking applications with external systems,
        * a four-person IBM IIB, IBM MQ and IBM DataPower team maintaining the integration infrastructure connecting externally with SABN and BankServe as well as non-core bank systems, and
        * a three-person team maintaining file-transfer infrastructure.

    - role: Principal Integration Developer
      time: Oct 2014 - Oct 2016
      company: BCX
      details: |
        Integration Standard Bank. Technical analysis of legacy PL SQL and JCaps Java code.

        Development of IBM IIB solutions. Scrum master of delivery teams on Foundation programme and Industrialization Project.
        
        Development of an AIX Environment Provisioning CI Pipeline MVP.

        I joined the Industrialization project at Standard Bank in October 2014. Starting as integration developer I transitioned to being the SCRUM master and tech specialist.

        Industrialization was an agile project to see how much of the local Max and realtime JavaCAPS interfaces could be redeveloped using a like-for-like replacement approach before a May 2015 deadline. Lacking access to a development environment, one was built using Innovation Centre VMs. A streamlined wiki-based documentation approach was developed after two iterations that factored the designs and documentation into reusable parts allowing very quick documentation generation. A solution architecture was developed with reusable common services that allowed full interface solutions to be implemented using database configurations and required only the actual mapping logic of an interface to be coded.

        I prototyped a code generation solution to produce IBM broker flows programmatically using the IBM API wrapped in a fluent Java API.

        A long dispute regarding naming standards between different teams resulted in me developing a small utility using the same API to programmatically rename message broker flows and nodes to align naming standards.

        When the Foundation program superseded the Industrialization project, the Industrialization team was absorbed into that program. I initially joined as one of two SCRUM masters, but after a Chef awareness session, I specialized for a few months to deliver an MVP to spin up the Africa ESB integration stack on AIX using Chef.

        During this time, I developed a set of cookbooks to automate IBM MQ, MQFTE and Message Broker installations on AIX and CentOS and to provision an Africa ESB environment using several custom light-weight resource providers to configure various MQ and Broker components. Minimal MQ enablement and Broker deployment functionality were developed as well.

        Development was done in a TDD fashion using Cucumber acceptance tests with custom Cucumber step implementations.

        Bamboo initially served as CI server, later to be replaced by Jenkins and GitLab.

        The MVP was completed in November 2015 and demoed executively February 2016, but various social and organisational factors including prohibitive licensing costs have prevented solution adoption within the bank.

        Project Manager for the Cordaptix Ukukala Project at Eskom.

        Ukukala was the implementation of an Eskom Distribution-wide Data Warehouse. The Cordaptix Ukukala sub-project was mainly involved in the specification of Key Performance Indicator business logic to enable the development of KPI extraction, calculation and verification solutions from the Cordaptix system (currently CC&B).

        Tasks and responsibilities included the management of a team tasked with the production of KPI definitions. Definitions included aspects of Business Analysis of the KPIs, but consisted mostly of Systems Analysis of the KPIs and their implementation as SQL scripts to express their Business Logic. Testing and optimization of the scripts was a key task as the Cordaptix Customer Care and Billing system database was a multi-terabyte database with very high transaction volumes and many multi-million row tables.

        The definitions needed to effectively document and clearly define the aspects of the Cordaptix Data Model being used.

        The management tasks included the management of the definition document approval process and sign-off by Business and Technical Subject Matter Experts as well as technical advice to Ukukala regarding the technical extract process. The resolution of technical extract problems required a high level of communication to clarify requirements and identify and resolve technical problems.

        The business requirements for the KPIs had to be confirmed, clarified and often corrected with business representatives. The technical requirements had to be confirmed, clarified and corrected with data warehouse as well as production system SMEs and technical issues had to be solved in an effective manner.
