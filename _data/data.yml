        Principal Developer and Secondary Lead on a eight person team 
        implementing a payment gateway for 
        [Transaction Junction](https://transactionjunction.co.za/).

        I did the analysis, design and implementation of the credit/debit card payment method backend 
        and then built out the _recurring and subscription payment_ and
        _saved card processing_ features for front- and backend. Implementations are done
        as Spring Boot microservices hosted on AWS ECS in fargate containers. Front ends
        are implemented in Javascript using React.

        I'm currently designing and implementing the Ozow payment method front end and back end.

        I serve as a second in command and hot standby for the Delivery Lead.
        
        I guided, mentored and assisted junior/intermediate/fellow developers with e.g.:
        
        * implementing a PHP WooCommerce Payment Gateway Plugin,
        * refactoring Cypress end-to-end tests,
        * understanding effective Spring unit test mocking,
        * designing a Spring API response caching subsystem for slowly changing data,
        * structuring payment method designs and delivery approaches,
        * etc.

      time: May 2022 - October 2022 (overlapping with TJ deployent)
      company: IdealSolution Software
      details: |
        Solution Architect on a five person team overseeing the delivery, 
        design and implementation of a rewrite of Mobile applications for 
        [Lighthouse](https://www.getlighthouse.app/) - a content moderation startup. 
        
        I was partially allocated to the project at 20h a month.

        My main duties were the initial project planning and scoping, contract and specification negotiations, delivery oversight, 
        coordinating and presenting client sprint demos, sprint reporting,
        performing code reviews, giving design assistance, troubleshooting and backend enhancements and fixes.

        When the Android client libraries for the Strongswan VPN being used by the solution turned our not to be viable in context of the solution,
        I did a quick POC that used Wireguard as an alternative and then rearchitected the solution to use Wireguard instead.
        Afterwards I implemented the Android Wireguard client code.

        I implemented a small VPN connectivity checking point solution that pings connected devices using
        a small Golang service hosted on the VPN server and a Javascript AWS lambda function.

        I guided, mentored and assisted my intermediate mobile developer with e.g.:
        * Android application architecture and design, especially w.r.t. state management,
        * payment and billing system design,
        * implementing Javascript lambda functions for periodic billing functions,
        * etc.
        
        I guided, mentored and assisted my testing specialist with e.g.:
        * Appium coding approaches,
        * effectively formulating, formatting and presenting his test reporting.

    - role: Solution Architect
      time: June 2021 - April 2022

      details: |
        Solution Architect and team lead for a seven person team implementing 
        a new content moderation solution for [Lighthouse](https://www.getlighthouse.app/).

        My main duties were: solution architecture and design, delivering solution components,
        initial project planning and scoping, contract and specification negotiations, 
        delivery oversight, coordinating and presenting client sprint demos, sprint reporting,
        performing code reviews, giving design assistance, troubleshooting and backend enhancements and fixes.

        We were initially contracted to develop a new content moderation system for schools that intercepts and filters 
        web traffic for images and videos and then moderates them using machine learning - blocking images classified as harmful, 
        but this quickly expanded into helping them solve several issues with the go-live of their first mobile content moderation system.

        I architected their school solution - personally delivering the on-school-prem proxy components and overseeing the delivery
        of the cloud-based management portal and AWS lambda-based back-end functions.

        I implemented the HTTPS-intercepting transparent proxy in Python as a MITMProxy plugin. This was a reimplementation
        of their first Javascript MVP proxy - adding the capacity to transparently filter devices that could not have their proxy settings
        remotely managed and I migrated their classification engine from a poorly performing, in-house trained, MachineBox model
        to [AWS Rekognition](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/).

        Their MVP mobile apps were implemented in Flutter and several core libraries were being deprecated. I reimplimented the
        Flutter app iOS specific networking code in Swift to cope with some of these challenges.

        When the Lighthouse DevOps resource resigned I stoGolangod in for him as far as possible in maintaining their AWS assets until a 
        DevOps resource could be provisioned.

        I specifically rolled out their first takeon of Keycloak and assited the developers with configuration and styling
        and helped them to get their Keycloak client code working by providing initial POC code.

        I initiated a cost control exercise to control exorbitant Azure spending. This was done by writing a small Golang Azure API client application
        that gathered and collated cost information across all Azure assets. I then used a simple R project to display the
        resultant data as Treemaps. In the first month we found a +-$10,000 cost line item that resulted from a logging misconfiguration.

        As member of a velocity team (our brief was: concept to POC, then handover to
        implementation team to do POC to MVP) I worked on analyzing a legacy codebase of more than
        15,000,000 lines of Java code to advise on refactoring approaches. This was done using a collection

        Integration Standard Bank. Technical analysis of legacy PL SQL and JCaps Java code.

        Development of IBM IIB solutions. Scrum master of delivery teams on Foundation programme and Industrialization Project.
        
        Development of an AIX Environment Provisioning CI Pipeline MVP.

        I joined the Industrialization project at Standard Bank in October 2014. 
        Starting as integration developer I transitioned to being the SCRUM master and tech specialist.

        Industrialization was an agile project to see how much of the local Max and realtime JavaCAPS interfaces could be redeveloped using a like-for-like replacement approach before a May 2015 deadline. Lacking access to a development environment, one was built using Innovation Centre VMs. A streamlined wiki-based documentation approach was developed after two iterations that factored the designs and documentation into reusable parts allowing very quick documentation generation. A solution architecture was developed with reusable common services that allowed full interface solutions to be implemented using database configurations and required only the actual mapping logic of an interface to be coded.

        I prototyped a code generation solution to produce IBM broker flows programmatically using the IBM API wrapped in a fluent Java API.

        A long dispute regarding naming standards between different teams resulted in me developing a small utility using the same API to programmatically rename message broker flows and nodes to align naming standards.

        When the Foundation program superseded the Industrialization project, the Industrialization team was absorbed into that program. I initially joined as one of two SCRUM masters, but after a Chef awareness session, I specialized for a few months to deliver an MVP to spin up the Africa ESB integration stack on AIX using Chef.

        During this time, I developed a set of cookbooks to automate IBM MQ, MQFTE and Message Broker installations on AIX and CentOS and to provision an Africa ESB environment using several custom light-weight resource providers to configure various MQ and Broker components. Minimal MQ enablement and Broker deployment functionality were developed as well.

        Development was done in a TDD fashion using Cucumber acceptance tests with custom Cucumber step implementations.

        Bamboo initially served as CI server, later to be replaced by Jenkins and GitLab.

        The MVP was completed in November 2015 and demoed executively February 2016, 
        but various social and organisational factors including prohibitive licensing costs prevented solution adoption within the bank.

      company: SiloFX
      details: |      
        Project Manager for the Cordaptix Ukukala Project at Eskom.

        Ukukala was the implementation of an Eskom Distribution-wide Data Warehouse. The Cordaptix Ukukala sub-project was mainly involved in the specification of Key Performance Indicator business logic to enable the development of KPI extraction, calculation and verification solutions from the Cordaptix system (currently CC&B).

        Tasks and responsibilities included the management of a team tasked with the production of KPI definitions. Definitions included aspects of Business Analysis of the KPIs, but consisted mostly of Systems Analysis of the KPIs and their implementation as SQL scripts to express their Business Logic. Testing and optimization of the scripts was a key task as the Cordaptix Customer Care and Billing system database was a multi-terabyte database with very high transaction volumes and many multi-million row tables.

        The definitions needed to effectively document and clearly define the aspects of the Cordaptix Data Model being used.

        The management tasks included the management of the definition document approval process and sign-off by Business and Technical Subject Matter Experts as well as technical advice to Ukukala regarding the technical extract process. The resolution of technical extract problems required a high level of communication to clarify requirements and identify and resolve technical problems.

        The business requirements for the KPIs had to be confirmed, clarified and often corrected with business representatives. The technical requirements had to be confirmed, clarified and corrected with data warehouse as well as production system SMEs and technical issues had to be solved in an effective manner.
